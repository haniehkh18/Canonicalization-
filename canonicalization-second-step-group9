Based on the given relations in group 9 and the instructions, here's the canonicalization proposal for that group:

**Original Relations:**
- contributes to
- required for
- decided step-by-step reduction in

**Canonicalized Group 9 Proposal:**
```
relation -> new relation
contributes to -> contributes to
needs reversal: no

relation -> new relation
required for -> contributes to
needs reversal: yes

relation -> new relation
decided step-by-step reduction in -> reduce step-by-step
needs reversal: yes
```

**Explanation:**
- "contributes to" retains its form since it is already suitably general for representing the action of aiding or leading to some effect or outcome.
- "required for" implies a necessity for something to occur or to be, which can be interpreted as a form of contribution when reversed, hence the reversal.
- "decided step-by-step reduction in" denotes a determined action towards gradually decreasing something, which is the opposite of contributing. Consequently, it is canonicalized to "reduce step-by-step" and also needs a reversal to align with the 'contributes to' action direction.

However, please note that while "contributes to" and "required for" might be considered generally related through the concept of necessity for an outcome, "decided step-by-step reduction in" might not be a semantic match in all contexts and could warrant a separate subgroup depending on the domain and specific usage of these terms. Since no context is given and based on general language use, I've placed them in one canonical group for this exercise.
