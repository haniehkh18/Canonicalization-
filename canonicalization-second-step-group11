For group 11, I will analyze the semantic relationship between "cause," "feed through into," and "consequence_of" and propose a common relation:

- "cause" implies that one event is the reason for another event happening.
- "feed through into" can be understood as a situation or action that results in another situation or condition.
- "consequence_of" clearly states that one event is the result of another event.

These relations all imply a cause-effect relationship. Therefore, a common relation to represent them could be 'cause'.

Here is the canonicalization for group 11:

| relation         | new relation |
|------------------|--------------|
| cause            | cause        |
| feed through into| cause        |
| consequence_of   | cause        |

| needs reversal: | yes or no |
|-----------------|-----------|
| cause           | no        |
| feed through into| yes      |
| consequence_of  | yes       |

So, the canonical form of these relations would be 'cause' and 'consequence_of' as well as 'feed through into' would need the subject and object to be reversed in order to fit into the canonical 'cause' relation.
