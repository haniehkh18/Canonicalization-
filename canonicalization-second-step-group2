Sure, I'll group the relations from Group 2 based on their semantic similarity and propose a common relation for each subgroup.

Group 2 Relations:
- has_risk
- affected_by_risk
- are risks to
- consequence_of
- hamper production of
- hamper_production_of
- cause delays in
- slow down recovery in
- less tightening due to
- could be a drag on

Here are the canonicalized relations and the proposed new relations:

Subgroup 2.1:
- has_risk -> risk_of
- affected_by_risk -> risk_of
   needs reversal: yes
- are risks to -> risk_of
   needs reversal: yes

Subgroup 2.2:
- consequence_of -> result_in
   needs reversal: yes
- has_consequence -> result_in (implied from consequence_of)
   needs reversal: no
- result_of -> result_in (implied from consequence_of)
   needs reversal: yes

Subgroup 2.3:
- hamper production of -> hinder_production_of
- hamper_production_of -> hinder_production_of

Subgroup 2.4:
- cause delays in -> cause_delay_in
- slow down recovery in -> cause_delay_in
   needs reversal: no (the context implies that the recovery itself is being delayed, not that the recovery is causing delays)
- could be a drag on -> cause_delay_in
   needs reversal: yes

Subgroup 2.5:
- less tightening due to -> reduce_intensity_of
   needs reversal: yes

For this task, I assumed a general context. However, relations could behave differently in specific contexts, so reversing might depend on the actual dataset's examples. Also, note that some relations were imagined based on their opposites or related phrases for completeness and better understanding of the semantic interplay.
