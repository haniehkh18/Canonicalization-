Based on the provided relations in Group 5, the following subgroups and canonicalizations can be proposed:

**Subgroup 5.1: Decision Making and Actions**
- "weighed_by" -> "affects"
- "took decisions in response to" -> "responds to"
- "decided to extend" -> "extends"

**Canonicalization:**
relation -> affects/responds to/extends
needs reversal: no for "affects"/"extends", yes for "weighed_by" and "took decisions in response to"

**Subgroup 5.2: Intention and Planned Actions**
- "intends to reinvest" -> "plans to"
- "will reduce pace of" -> "plans to reduce"
- "has reinvestment deadline until" -> "deadline for"

**Canonicalization:**
relation -> plans to/deadline for
needs reversal: no for "intends to reinvest" and "will reduce pace of", yes for "has reinvestment deadline until"

**Subgroup 5.3: Transactional Relations**
- "purchased under" -> "purchases"
- "tightens in" -> "tightens"

**Canonicalization:**
relation -> purchases/tightens
needs reversal: yes for "tightens in", no for "purchased under"

Please note some relations such as "benefited_from", "should complement", and "needs to maintain" do not seem to have clear semantic similarities with the other relations in the context of this task and might either stand alone or need the inclusion of other relations for proper grouping. Additionally, without more detailed domain-specific context, it may be necessary to review and adjust these groupings.
