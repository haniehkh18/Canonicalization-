Points to Note:
1. Some relations could potentially fit into multiple categories, depending on the specific context in which they are used. Decisions were made based on typical use cases.
2. Variations of a relation (e.g., "increases expenses on" and "increases expenses") have been included in the same category, assuming they represent the same semantic relationship.
3. The categories created are meant to group the relations by their high-level meaning and purpose, with some flexibility given the abstraction involved.
4. It's important to remember that while certain relations seem similar, in practice, they might be used in different domain-specific contexts which would necessitate keeping them separate. This could only be determined with full context and usage examples, which are not provided here.
