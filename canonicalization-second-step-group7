Certainly! Below, I've created groups of relations from group 7 based on their semantic similarity. Where a reverse of subject and object is required, I have mentioned it accordingly.

```json
{
    "group A": [
        "estimated to be",
        "predicts",
        "expected to ease by",
        "foresight of",
        "could be higher",
        "assesses",
        "judged"
    ],
    "group B": [
        "compared_with",
        "relates"
        // "excluding_component" can be seen as a comparative context but often has a different functional meaning (exclusion rather than comparison).
    ],
    "group C": [
        "perceives",
        "is considered"
    ],
    "group D": [
        "timed_at",
        "occurred_in",
        "state_for"
    ],
    "group E": [
        "supports",
        "addresses",
        "preserves"
    ],
    "group F": [
        "influences",
        "impact on"
    ],
    "group G": [
        "prevents"
        // Note: "prevents" could potentially fit into Group F if framed as "negative influence."
    ]
}

// No direct or exact common relation could be efficiently extracted for some terms like "excluding_component", as they serve a different semantic function in context.
```

Here are the conclusions in the desired format:

```
relation -> new relation
needs reversal: yes or no

Group A:
"estimated to be/predicts/expected to ease by/foresight of/could be higher/assesses/judged" -> "estimates"
needs reversal: no

Group B:
"compared_with/relates" -> "compared with"
needs reversal: no

Group C:
"perceives/is considered" -> "considers"
needs reversal: no

Group D:
"timed_at/occurred_in/state_for" -> "occurs at"
needs reversal: no

Group E:
"supports/addresses/preserves" -> "supports"
needs reversal: no

Group F:
"influences/impact on" -> "influences"
needs reversal: no

Group G:
"prevents" -> "prevents"
needs reversal: no
```

Points to Note:
1. Some relations could potentially fit into multiple categories, depending on the specific context in which they are used. Decisions were made based on typical use cases.
2. Variations of a relation (e.g., "increases expenses on" and "increases expenses") have been included in the same category, assuming they represent the same semantic relationship.
3. The categories created are meant to group the relations by their high-level meaning and purpose, with some flexibility given the abstraction involved.
4. Although certain relations appear similar, in practice, they might be used in different domain-specific contexts which could necessitate keeping them separate. Context and usage examples would be necessary to make definitive categorizations.

Please let me know if there are specific relations that you believe have been misgrouped or if further refinement is needed.
