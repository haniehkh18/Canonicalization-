Based on the semantic similarity and context of the relations in Group 4, here is a canonicalization attempt. Note that decisions are made with information provided, without additional context or usage examples, which could potentially refine these groupings:

---

**Original Relation** -> **Canonical Relation**
**Needs Reversal**

expected_to_ease_by -> ease
No

persist for some time -> persist
No

start to ease during -> ease
No

improved by -> improve
Yes

transitions from -> transition from
No

followed by -> follow
Yes

returns more quickly to -> return to
Yes

remains_robust_for -> remain robust for
No

strengthened -> strengthen
No

improvement_indicator -> indicate improvement
No

observed progress toward -> observe progress toward
No

---

In summary, the canonical relations for Group 4 emphasize the state of improvement, persistence, and strength, with the verbs adjusted to a more general form. However, when "improved by," "followed by," and "returns more quickly to" are canonicalized, the subject and object of the relation would need to be reversed to maintain the same meaning after canonicalization.
