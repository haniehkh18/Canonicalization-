Based on the information provided and the semantic similarity of the relations, here is a proposed canonicalization for Group 3:

- revised_in -> revised
- revised_compared_with -> revised
- revision_period -> revise over period
- adjusted for -> adjusted
- revision_for -> revised
- revised_to -> revised
- remain stable since -> stability since
- have remained stable since -> stability since

Output:
```
relation -> new relation
needs reversal: yes or no

revised_in -> revised
needs reversal: no

revised_compared_with -> revised
needs reversal: no

revision_period -> revise over period
needs reversal: no

adjusted for -> adjusted
needs reversal: no

revision_for -> revised
needs reversal: no

revised_to -> revised
needs reversal: no

remain stable since -> stability since
needs reversal: no

have remained stable since -> stability since
needs reversal: no
```

In each case, the original relation is mapped onto the proposed canonical relation. If the meaning of the relationship requires the subject and object to be swapped for the canonical form, then reversal would be necessary, but none of the relations in Group 3 require that.
